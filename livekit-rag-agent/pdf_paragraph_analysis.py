VOICE AI INTEGRATION GUIDE

Introduction
Our Voice AI platform provides enterprise-grade voice automation solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing business systems. The platform processes natural language queries and provides intelligent responses using advanced machine learning models. Implementation typically requires minimal changes to existing infrastructure while providing immediate value through automated customer interactions.

System Requirements
The Voice AI platform requires specific technical infrastructure to ensure optimal performance. Server requirements include a minimum of 8GB RAM, 4-core CPU running at 2.4GHz or higher, and 50GB of available storage space. Network connectivity must support sustained bandwidth of at least 10 Mbps for concurrent voice processing. The system supports both cloud and on-premises deployment options.

Audio Processing Capabilities
Our advanced audio processing engine handles multiple audio formats including WAV, MP3, and real-time streaming protocols. The system processes audio in real-time with typical latency under 200 milliseconds from speech input to text output. Background noise suppression algorithms automatically filter ambient sounds while preserving speech clarity. The platform supports sampling rates from 8kHz to 48kHz depending on quality requirements.

Integration Architecture
The platform exposes RESTful APIs for seamless integration with existing applications. Authentication uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0 with optional API key authentication for simplified implementations. Webhook endpoints allow real-time notifications for conversation events, system alerts, and usage analytics. The system maintains conversation context across multiple interactions to provide coherent dialogue experiences.

Security and Compliance
Security implementation follows enterprise standards with end-to-end encryption for all communications. Data encryption uses AES-256 standards both in transit and at rest. The platform maintains SOC 2 Type II compliance and supports GDPR requirements for data privacy. Role-based access controls ensure appropriate permission levels for different user types. Regular security audits and penetration testing validate system integrity.

Performance Optimization
Response time optimization techniques ensure sub-second performance for typical queries. Caching mechanisms store frequently accessed information to reduce processing overhead. Load balancing algorithms distribute traffic across multiple processing nodes for scalability. The system automatically scales resources based on demand patterns to maintain consistent performance during peak usage periods.

Troubleshooting Common Issues
Audio quality problems typically stem from network latency or inadequate bandwidth allocation. Increasing buffer sizes and ensuring stable network connections resolves most audio-related issues. Authentication failures usually indicate incorrect API credentials or expired tokens that require regeneration through the admin dashboard. Performance degradation often results from insufficient system resources and can be addressed through scaling or resource allocation adjustments.

API AUTHENTICATION GUIDE

Overview
The Voice AI API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication with Bearer tokens for secure access. All API endpoints require valid authentication credentials passed in the Authorization header. Token expiration is set to 24 hours for security purposes.

Getting Started
To authenticate with the API, first obtain your client credentials from the developer dashboard. Navigate to Settings > API Keys to generate your client ID and secret. These credentials are used to request access tokens from the authentication endpoint.

Token Request Process
Send a POST request to https://api.voiceai.com/oauth/token with your client credentials. Include grant_type=client_credentials in the request body along with your client_id and client_secret. The response contains an access_token valid for 24 hours.

Example Request
curl -X POST https://api.voiceai.com/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"

Using Access Tokens
Include the access token in the Authorization header for all API requests. Format the header as "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN". Tokens automatically expire after 24 hours and must be renewed.

Error Handling
Common authentication errors include 401 Unauthorized for invalid tokens and 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions. Implement token refresh logic to handle expiration gracefully. Rate limiting may return 429 Too Many Requests if token requests exceed limits.

Security Best Practices
Store client credentials securely and never expose them in client-side code. Implement proper token storage with encryption at rest. Use HTTPS for all API communications to prevent token interception. Rotate credentials regularly according to your security policies.
