API INTEGRATION GUIDE

Overview
Our Voice AI API provides programmatic access to all voice assistant capabilities. The RESTful API supports real-time voice processing, conversation management, and system integration.

Authentication
All API requests require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the Authorization header:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

Base URL: https://api.voiceai.company.com/v1

Rate Limits
- Free tier: 1,000 requests per hour
- Professional: 10,000 requests per hour  
- Enterprise: Unlimited with dedicated infrastructure

Voice Processing Endpoints

POST /voice/process
Processes audio input and returns text transcription plus AI response.

Request Parameters:
- audio_data: Base64 encoded audio (required)
- language: Language code (optional, default: en-US)
- context: Additional context for AI (optional)
- session_id: Conversation session ID (optional)

Response Format:
{
  "transcription": "What are your business hours?",
  "ai_response": "We're available 24/7 to assist you.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "processing_time_ms": 847
}

Error Handling
The API returns standard HTTP status codes. Common errors:
- 400: Invalid request parameters
- 401: Authentication failed
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
- 500: Internal server error

All errors include detailed error messages in JSON format.

Webhooks
Configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications for conversation events, system alerts, and usage metrics.

SDK Support
Official SDKs available for Python, JavaScript, Java, and C#. Community SDKs available for additional languages.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

Infrastructure Components

Load Balancer
High-availability load balancers distribute traffic across multiple application servers. Supports automatic failover and geographic distribution for optimal performance.

Application Servers
Containerized microservices architecture running on Kubernetes. Each service handles specific functionality:
- Voice Processing Service: Handles STT and TTS operations
- AI Reasoning Service: Manages LLM interactions and context
- Session Management Service: Maintains conversation state
- Integration Service: Handles external API connections

Database Architecture
Multi-tier database architecture ensures scalability and reliability:
- Redis: Session state and real-time caching
- PostgreSQL: User data and configuration storage  
- Vector Database: Knowledge base embeddings and similarity search
- Time-series DB: Analytics and performance metrics

Security Implementation
Enterprise-grade security across all system layers:
- TLS 1.3 encryption for all communications
- OAuth 2.0 and SAML for authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring ensures system reliability:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Distributed tracing for request flows
- Automated alerting for anomalies
- 24/7 NOC monitoring

Disaster Recovery
Robust disaster recovery ensures business continuity:
- Multi-region deployment with automatic failover
- Real-time data replication
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 15 minutes
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 5 minutes

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

Common Issues and Solutions

Audio Quality Problems

Poor Recognition Accuracy
If speech recognition accuracy is below 90%, check the following:
- Ensure microphone input level is between -12dB and -6dB
- Minimize background noise in the environment
- Verify network bandwidth meets minimum requirements (256 kbps)
- Check for audio codec compatibility issues

Choppy or Distorted Audio
Audio distortion typically indicates network or processing issues:
- Test network latency (should be under 150ms)
- Verify CPU usage is below 80% on client devices
- Check for firewall blocking UDP traffic on ports 3478-3479
- Ensure adequate bandwidth allocation for real-time audio

Connection Issues

Authentication Failures
Authentication problems usually involve API key configuration:
- Verify API key is correctly copied without extra spaces
- Check API key permissions in the dashboard
- Ensure API key hasn't expired (keys expire every 12 months)
- Confirm your IP address is whitelisted if IP restrictions are enabled

Timeout Errors
Connection timeouts may indicate network or server issues:
- Standard timeout is 30 seconds for API requests
- Check your internet connection stability
- Verify our service status at status.voiceai.company.com
- Try reducing request payload size if sending large audio files

Performance Optimization

Reducing Latency
To achieve sub-2-second response times:
- Use nearest geographic endpoint (US, EU, or APAC)
- Implement connection pooling to avoid handshake overhead
- Cache frequently accessed data locally
- Use streaming audio instead of batch processing

Scaling for High Volume
For handling 1000+ concurrent conversations:
- Implement proper load balancing across multiple instances
- Use Redis for session state management
- Enable horizontal auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics
- Consider dedicated infrastructure for enterprise volume

INTEGRATION EXAMPLES

CRM Integration

Salesforce Integration
Integrate voice AI with Salesforce to automatically log customer interactions and update records.

Configuration Steps:
1. Create connected app in Salesforce with OAuth 2.0
2. Configure webhook endpoints in voice AI dashboard
3. Map conversation data to Salesforce fields
4. Set up real-time sync for contact updates

Code Example (Python):
```python
import requests

def update_salesforce_contact(contact_id, conversation_summary):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {sf_access_token}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    
    data = {
        'Last_Conversation__c': conversation_summary,
        'Last_Contact_Date__c': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    response = requests.patch(
        f'{sf_instance_url}/services/data/v52.0/sobjects/Contact/{contact_id}',
        headers=headers,
        json=data
    )
    
    return response.status_code == 200
```

Phone System Integration

Asterisk PBX Integration
Connect voice AI to Asterisk PBX for automated call handling.

Configuration Requirements:
- Asterisk version 16.0 or higher
- SIP trunk configuration with authentication
- Dialplan modifications for AI routing
- AGI script for voice AI communication

Sample Dialplan:
```
[incoming-ai]
exten => _X.,1,Answer()
same => n,Set(CHANNEL(language)=en)
same => n,AGI(voiceai-connector.py,${CALLERID(num)})
same => n,Hangup()
```

The AGI script handles the communication between Asterisk and the voice AI service, managing audio streaming and response routing.

Microsoft Teams Integration
Enable voice AI within Microsoft Teams for internal support and assistance.

Setup Process:
1. Register application in Azure AD
2. Configure bot framework endpoints
3. Deploy Teams app package
4. Configure permissions for voice access

Custom Integration
For custom applications, use our WebSocket API for real-time voice streaming.

WebSocket Endpoint: wss://api.voiceai.company.com/v1/stream

Connection requires authentication token and supports bidirectional audio streaming with real-time transcription and response generation.
